# Quotes on Dev

This site is a WordPress theme for the website Quotes on Dev, a creation of Red Academy used for students to practice their WordPress API skills. This site is a culmination of several static pages, such as an about page and tag and category archives, as well as a REST API home screen that accesses a JSON database to produce quotes using a jQuery .onclick function. It is also a responsive site, using SASS media queries with mobile, tablet, and desktop modes.
